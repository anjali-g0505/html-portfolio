<h1>My Favourite Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2> The Top 3</h2>

<h3>3 idiots</h3>
<p>This movie is in Hindi, an Indian language. It is a comedy-drama film made for all age-groups</p>
<h3>Despicable Me</h3>
<p> This movie is an animated film which is my personal favourite. It has a very comforting, nostalgic feel to it.</p>
<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
<p> This is a series and has 4 seasons, the latest one is scheduled to arrive in late 2025.</p>
